# Assignment #3 from IntroSDE Lab
For this assignment I worked on my own. The URL of my heroku server and the wsld file is the following: https://anadaniel-introsde-a03.herokuapp.com/ws/people?wsdl

### The Client
The build xml includes a target to run the Client part of the assignment that sends requests to my heroku server and prints the responses to a log file called `client.log`
The source code for the server can be found in this repository: https://github.com/anadaniel/introsde-2015-assignment-3-server

### How to execute

```
  git clone git@github.com:anadaniel/introsde-2015-assignment-3-client.git
  cd introsde-2015-assignment-3-client
  ant execute.client
```
